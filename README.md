 Machining Analysis of Additively Manufactured Metallic Components with Varied Density

Overview
Machining study on additively manufactured metallic components with varied density (porosity).  
Cutting forces were measured using a dynamometer and tool wear was analyzed using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images.

 What I Did
- Used a dynamometer to measure cutting forces during machining for different density samples
- Compared force fluctuations across samples to understand loading nature during machining
- Analyzed tool wear using SEM images and linked wear with force changes

 Experimental Setup


 Cutting Force Analysis


 Tool Wear Analysis (SEM Images)


 Key Insight
 As density decreases, porosity increases → loading becomes fluctuating in nature → resulting in higher tool wear rates.
